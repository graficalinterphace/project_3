    <h1>Introduction to Norse Gods</h1>
    <p>This page will provide a non-comprehensive list of the most major Norse gods (as described in myths) and provide a breif summary covering them. There is no single comprehensive canon in Norse mythology, so this page is based on the most popular source of myths, the <em>Prose Edda</em>.</p>
