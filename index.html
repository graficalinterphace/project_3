  <h1>ITMD-361 Project 2</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website! These pages have been created for a class project. This specific page describe the project introduce each page. The first step of this project is to create three websites using only HTML, then publish them to GitHub. In this lesson I learned the basics of structuring websites and links in GitHub. The next step is to style the pages using CSS files.</p>

    <img src="/project_2/docs/assets/me.jpg" alt="Me" id="meimg">
    <p>I am an ITM student interested in cybersecurity. I think web development is very interesting and I'm always trying to learn more! HTML has been quite fun, but CSS is a lot more confusing for me since there are so many different features to use and remember. I enjoy playing games and listening to electronic music.</p>
    <p>Here is a song I like:</p>
